# Agent Instructions

## About this repo

`relay` implements frozen MCP `2026-07-28` server/client behavior for Gleam over stdio and Streamable HTTP. The native pending ledger preserves unbuilt full-scope capabilities and unresolved guarantees.

Ports/wraps: Model Context Protocol. Design: [docs/design/design.typ](docs/design/design.typ), [rendered design](docs/design/design-layer.pdf), [vocabulary](docs/design/CONTEXT.typ), and [decision rationale](docs/adr/).

Before changing a public facade, read the [public API guidelines](https://github.com/gleam-dream/oversight/blob/main/PUBLIC-API-GUIDELINES.md). Check common use, advanced configuration, caller-owned types and failure handling through a separate consumer. Preserve full intended capability scope.

## Tooling

- `nix develop` (or direnv): dev shell with `gleam`, Erlang/OTP 28, `rebar3`, `lefthook`.
- `nix fmt`: formats the whole repo via treefmt (`gleam format`, `nixfmt`, `prettier`).
- `lefthook`: pre-commit hook formats staged files and re-stages them.
- `nix flake check`: fails iff the tree is not formatted (plus any existing checks).
- `gleam test`: runs the test suite.

## Agent skills

**Design layer** — `docs/design/design.typ` describes the design,
`docs/design/CONTEXT.typ` defines its vocabulary, and `docs/adr/` records
decision rationale. The rendered document is `docs/design/design-layer.pdf`.
`docs/COVERAGE.md` maps repository parts to their design owners.

**Tracker** — GitHub issues in `gleam-dream/relay`, accessed with
`gh issue list --repo gleam-dream/relay` and `gh issue view NUMBER --repo gleam-dream/relay`.
Labels bind roles as follows: `needs-triage` → `needs-triage`,
`needs-info` → `question`, `ready-for-agent` → `ready-for-agent`,
`ready-for-human` → `ready-for-human`, `in-progress` → `in-progress`,
`done` → `done`, `wontfix` → `wontfix`, `bug` → `bug`,
and `enhancement` → `enhancement`.

**AI disclaimer** — AI-authored tracker comments start with
`AI-assisted contribution.`

**Design gate** — `nix run .#design-gate-check -- docs/design .` checks render freshness,
vocabulary references and layer integrity (exit 0 clean, 1 violation, 2 error).
The gate is supplied by the pinned `design-layer` flake input.
`nix run .#design-gate-render -- docs/design docs/design/design-layer.pdf`
rebuilds the rendered document. `nix run .#design-gate-context -- docs/design --estimate`
estimates agent context; the same command without `--estimate` emits ephemeral
Markdown. `--manifest`, `--preview`, and `--section PATH --expect-digest DIGEST`
support loading selected sections. A bare Typst compilation does not run the gate.

**Context verification** — use native semantic blocks for lists, tables,
models and behavior. After authoring, verify context estimation and a selected
section export as well as rendering and the design gate.
Run these commands sequentially for each layer; they share its generated
`.render` workspace.

**Staleness** — source changes since the design last changed require a
conformance review before the layer is treated as current.
